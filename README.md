## TODO:
* stochastic rules â€“ including in evolution (sample a few phenotypes? expected values?)
* stream generations to the FE?
* number of instances drawn of each species should scale with fitness
* other facets of light, e.g. angle of incidence, duration, etc.
* other facets of temperature, e.g. range (extremes)
* possibly some more realistic appearances, e.g. leaves, flowers, weight, varying thickness
