# fractals

## TODO:
* stochastic rules â€“ including in evolution (sample a few phenotypes? expected values?)
* make everything consistently radians!
* pass environment params from the FE
* stream generations to the FE?
* possibly some more realistic appearances, e.g. leaves, flowers, weight, varying thickness
