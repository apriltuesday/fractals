# fractals

## TODO:
* implement stability function
* height & width scores should saturate, plants can't grow too big
* variable light conditions?
* save image of top-scorer from each generation
* parameterized elements
* stochastic rules â€“ including in evolution
* ghostscript dependency...?
* improve image quality
* environment params, e.g. tropism vector, wind?
