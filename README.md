# fractals

## TODO:
* multiple variables for evolution (F & X)
* parameterized elements (necessary for some more realistic models)
* stochastic rules â€“ including in evolution
* context-sensitive

* possibly some more realistic appearances, e.g. leaves, weight
* environment params, e.g. tropism vector (varying through time?), wind, temperature, rainfall...
* eventually: website where you can set environment and evolve some plants
* probably need to re-implement drawing without turtle
